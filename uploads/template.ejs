   <!--Enter the description of the problem here-->
  <p>Suppose three different locations/zones which must be connected by means of radio frequency links: locations a, b and c. Location a is directly connected to the Internet, whereas locations b and c are not. 
  Assume that there is a distance of 1.5Km between each location (that is, they are arranged in a triangle of 1.5Km side length).</p>
  <p>In <strong>location b</strong> Internet access must be provided by means of two networks with SSIDs <strong>"empleados" (workers) and "visitantes" (guests)</strong>. The network "empleados" will be protected by <strong>WPA2-Enterprise</strong> and the network "visitantes" by a <strong> captive portal</strong> (only).</p>
  <p>Clients from both networks will receive their <strong>IP addresses dynamically</strong>. Clients of "empleados" will receive an IP range between 192.168.0.100 and 192.168.0.200. Clients of "visitantes" will recieve IPs between 192.168.2.100 and 192.168.2.200.</p>
  <p><strong>Location c</strong> will just provide Internet access through the <strong>"empleados" SSID</strong>, with the same security and IPs than in location b.</p>
  <p>In order to create the radio frequency links, the following devices can be selected:  LiteBeam LBE-M5-23, LBE-5AC-23, LBE-5AC-16-120.
   For every location choose the most appropriate one with the only condition that they must support MIMO technology. The manufacturer provides a tolerance that denotes how the maximum transmission power and the sensitivity may vary. Always consider the worst-case scenario.</p>
  <p>Assume that location b requires transmissions at <strong>30Mbps</strong> and location c requires <strong>20Mbps</strong>. You must set the properties of each of the devices forming the radio frequency links so that it can be guaranteed that both locations are able to transmit simultaneously at the maximum rate. Use the tables provided by the manufacturer and those of <a href="http://mcsindex.com" target="_blank">mcsindex.com</a>. Consider 20 MHz bandwidth channels. Assume that devices ise a guard interval (GI) of 400ns.</p>
  <p>Propagation loss in free space will be 115 dB for each radio frequency link, the maximum EIRP will be 1W and the fade margin of 10dB (it is not necessary to enter them, the program will apply and check them automatically).</p>
  
  <p>Considerations: 
  <ul>
    <li>
      You must use lowercase letters for all the properties of the items
    </li>
    <li>
      Possible values of the security field of aps/vaps are open/wpa2-enterprise/wpa2-personal
    </li>    
    <li>
      Change the zone (location) property in the "wireless-link" nodes (the rest of nodes will be updated automatically)
    </li>
  </ul></p>

/*  In order to specify the constraints that must be met, consider the following:
  - Keep the challenge_id line as is, with no modifications
  - The description is not necessary (it must be entered in the upload form). This field will be removed in the future.
  - Every constraint has a type (from the above) and a "desc" field, used for the output of results.
  - The "DHCP(visitantes)" constraint above tells NetEval to check that all nodes with essid/ssid equal to "visitantes" must be configured by a DHCP server configured with the range 192.168.2.100 - 192.168.2.200 and no other DHCP servers
  - Idem for "DHCP(empleados)", with different IP ranges and SSIDs
  - Nodes with SSID "empleados" must be configured with WPA2-Enterprise security. The node-props properties defines the properties that will be used to select to which nodes the restriction apply. Security_props specify the values that must be found in the nodes (normally security field). Connectivity with a RADIUS server and the existence shared password will aso be checked.
  - Very similar description for "Captive portal (visitantes)" (altough the checkings that will be performed are those of the captive constraint)
  - "zone b" checks that there is a location with a wireless-link device whose "zone" field must be set to "b". In that location must also be some nodes with "essid" equal to "visitantes" and "essid" equal to "empleados", as well. In the same way it could have been possible to specify nodes forbidden in that zone (not done in this example)
  - Idem for "zone c"
  - The "wireless-link a - b" constraint requires that there is a connection between the wireless-link nodes of zones a and b (identified by the properties specified in "bs_props" and "subscribers_props"). It also specifies the values that must be set as sensitivity, the maximum transmission power and EIRP allowes, the Propagation loss of the link and the fade margin
  - Idem for wireless-link a - c
  - Even if not specified the tool will check the correctness of the graph (i.e. numbers of interfaces per device, coherent connections, etc.)
  - For the above constraints, not entering any node that matches the specified properties will result in an error
  - Most the constraints support the use of arrays for selecting different types of nodes to which apply the constraint (see "zone b" constraint for an example of use of arrays)*/
